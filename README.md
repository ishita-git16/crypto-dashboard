# Ethereum 
## Ethereum Daily Price, Volume Variation Trends (2021) :
The Ethereum (ETH) price in USD soared to new heights in November 2021, reaching over 4,800 U.S. dollars as displayed in the graph.

## Environmental Impact:
Ethereum, like most major cryptocurrencies, is built on a system called “proof of work” that is incredibly energy hungry.

* Solana 
## Low Transaction Rate and costs:
Solana can handle much more transactions per second than Ethereum. The live Solana price today is $183.56 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,585,204,429 USD.

## Price and Volume Trends:
Solana has been a top performer in 2021, rising through the ranks of altcoins to become the
fourth-most-valuable cryptocurrency in the world.

* Comparison 
1) The competition between layer ones has been raging since the introduction of various
decentralized applications and non-fungible tokens in 2021.
2) A crucial selling point for Solana is certainly its ability to process a block every 400 milliseconds and its record 60k transactions per second. Just these features alone make it one of the fastest performing layer-one blockchains. 
3) Since ethereum is older than Solana its development community generally agrees with each other and they all share a similar vision of where they see the technology going. Ethereum has come under much scrutiny because of the fact of environmental harms caused by it, and shifting the entirety of NFT applications on Solana might be a nice move.
